\title{Encompassing Bayes Factor}
\usage{
compute_bf(k, n, A, b, prior = c(1, 1), M = 5e+05, steps, batch = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{the number of Option B choices.
The default \code{k=0} an \code{n=0} is equivalent to sampling from the prior.}

\item{n}{the number of choices per item type.}

\item{A}{a matrix with one row for each linear inequality constraint and one
column for each of the binomial parameters. The parameter space is defined
as all probabilities \code{x} that fulfill the order constraints  \code{A*x <= b}.}

\item{b}{a vector of the same length as the number of rows of \code{A}}

\item{prior}{a vector with two positive numbers defining the shape parameters of the beta prior distributions for each binomial rate parameter}

\item{M}{number of posterior samples drawn from the encompassing model}

\item{steps}{integer vector that indicates at which rows the matrix \code{A} is split for a stepwise computation of the Bayes factor (see details). In this case, \code{M} can be a vector with the number of samples drawn in each step from the (partially) order-constrained models using Gibbs sampling}

\item{batch}{size of the batches into which computations are split to reduce memory load}
}
\value{
a matrix with estiamtes (first column) and standard errors (second column) for the Bayes factor and log BF of the order-constrained vs. encompassing (\code{bf_0e}) and the encompassing vs. order-constrained (\code{bf_e0}) model
}
\description{
Computes the Bayes factor for order-constrained product-binomial models
that are specified as a polytope via:  A*x <= b (see details).
}
\details{
For more control how many samples should be drawn from the prior/posterior, use \code{\link{count_binomial}}.
This is especially recommended if the same prior distribution (and thus the same integral)
is used for computing BFs for multiple data sets that differ only in \code{k} and \code{n}.
