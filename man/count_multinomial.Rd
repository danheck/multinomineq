\title{Number of Product-Multinomial Prior/Posterior Samples in Polytope}
\usage{
count_multinomial(k = 0, options, A, b, V, prior = rep(1, sum(options)), M,
  steps, batch = 10000, start = -1, progress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{the number of choices for each alternative ordered by item type, e.g.
\code{c(a1,a2,a3, b1,b2)}.
The default \code{k=0} is equivalent to sampling from the prior.}

\item{options}{the number of choice options per item type, e.g., \code{c(3,2)} for a ternary and binary item.
The sum of \code{options} must be equal to the length of \code{k}.}

\item{A}{a matrix defining the convex polytope via A*x <= b.
The columns of A do not include the last choice option per item type and
thus the number of columns must be equal to \code{sum(options-1)} (e.g., the column order of \code{A}
for \code{k = c(a1,a2,a2, b1,b2)} is \code{c(a1,a2, b1)}).}

\item{b}{a vector of the same length as the number of rows of \code{A}.}

\item{V}{a matrix of vertices (one per row) that define the polytope of
admissible parameters as the convex hull over these points
(if provided, \code{A} and \code{b} are ignored). Note that this method
is comparatively slow since it solves a linear-programming problem for each point (Fukuda, 2004).}

\item{prior}{the prior parameters of the Dirichlet-shape parameters.
Must have the same length as \code{k}.}

\item{M}{number of posterior samples drawn from the encompassing model}

\item{steps}{integer vector that indicates at which rows the matrix \code{A} is split for a stepwise computation of the Bayes factor (see details). In this case, \code{M} can be a vector with the number of samples drawn in each step from the (partially) order-constrained models using Gibbs sampling}

\item{batch}{size of the batches into which computations are split to reduce memory load}

\item{start}{only if \code{steps} is defined: a vector with starting values
within the polytope. If \code{steps = -1}, a random starting value is used
(but a poitn within the polytope might not be found if the order constraints are strong).}

\item{progress}{whether a progress bar should be shown.}
}
\value{
a list with the elements
\itemize{
    \item\code{integral}: estimated probability that samples are in polytope
    \item\code{count}: number of samples in polytope
    \item\code{M}: total number of samples
}
}
\description{
Draws prior/posterior samples for product-multinomial data and counts how many samples are
inside the convex polytope defined by
(1) the inequalities A*x <= b or
(2) the convex hull over the vertices V.
