Description: 
    Implements Gibbs sampling and Bayes factors for multinomial models with
    convex, linear-inequality constraints on the probability parameters. This 
    includes models that predict a linear order of binomial probabilities 
    (e.g., p1 < p2 < p3 < .50) and mixture models, which assume that the 
    parameter vector p must be inside the convex hull of a finite number of 
    vertices. Inequality-constrained multinomial models have applications in the
    area of judgment and decision making to fit and test random utility models 
    (Regenwetter, M., Dana, J., & Davis-Stober, C. P. (2011). 
    Transitivity of preferences. Psychological Review, 118, 42–56,
    <doi:10.1037/a0021150>) or to perform outcome-based strategy classification 
    (i.e., to select the strategy that provides the best account for a vector of 
    observed choice frequencies; Heck, D. W., Hilbig, B. E., & Moshagen, M. 
    (2017). From information processing to decisions: Formalizing and comparing
