## Overview

Implements Gibbs sampling and Bayes factors for multinomial models with
convex, linear-inequality constraints on the probability parameters. This
includes models that predict a linear order of binomial probabilities
(e.g., p1 < p2 < p3 < .50) and mixture models, which assume that the
parameter vector p must be inside the convex hull of a finite number of
vertices. Inequality-constrained multinomial models have applications in the
area of judgment and decision making to fit and test random utility models
(Regenwetter, M., Dana, J., & Davis-Stober, C. P. (2011).
Transitivity of preferences. Psychological Review, 118, 42–56,
<doi:10.1037/a0021150>) or to perform outcome-based strategy classification
(i.e., to select the strategy that provides the best account for a vector of
observed choice frequencies; Heck, D. W., Hilbig, B. E., & Moshagen, M.
(2017). From information processing to decisions: Formalizing and comparing
probabilistic choice models. Cognitive Psychology, 96, 26–40.
